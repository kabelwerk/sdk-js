## Submitting bug reports

If you want to report a bug you can use the repository's [issue tracker](https://github.com/kabelwerk/sdk-js/issues) or you can contact us directly by email; the latter should be preferred if you want to report a security vulnerability.


## Contributing code

### Setup

```sh
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/kabelwerk/sdk-js
cd sdk-js

# install the dependencies
npm install

# run the unit tests
npm test

# check it out in a browser at localhost:8080
npm run demo
```
