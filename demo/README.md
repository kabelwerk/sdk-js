# Kabelwerk Demo

A simple React webapp showcasing the Kabelwerk SDK for JavaScript.

## üñ•Ô∏è Run locally

The demo webapp has its own `package.json` and dependencies, separate from those of the SDK itself. It uses the [Evergreen](https://evergreen.segment.com/) UI component library for the design and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as build tool.

```sh
# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/kabelwerk/sdk-js

# enter the project dir
cd sdk-js

# install the SDK dependencies
npm install

# enter the demo dir
cd demo

# install the demo dependencies
npm install

# run the development server at localhost:1234
npm start
```
